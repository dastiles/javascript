            <!-- <h1>Data structures</h1> -->
            <p>
              Data structures are a way of storing data in a computer system so
              that operations can be performed more efficiently
            </p>
            <p>Eight major Data structures To master</p>
            <h2>Arrays</h2>
            <p>
              Array is collection of items that are stored sequentially starting
              from index 0. You can access items in array using index. Also you
              can add , remove and sort etc items stored in the array. It's most
              likely that you have encountered arrays before if you have done
              any type of programming
            </p>

            <h2>Linked List</h2>
            <p>
              A Linked list is a collection of objects called nodes. Each node
              is linked to a successor node in the list using an object
              reference. The reference to another link is called a link.
            </p>
            <p>
              While arrays are referenced by their index position linked list
              elements are referenced by their relationship to the other linked
              list
            </p>

            <h2>Stacks</h2>
            <p>
              Stack is a list elements that are accessible only from the end of
              list which is called the top.
            </p>
            <p>
              Real world example of stack is books put on top of each other on
              the table whereby you start reading the book at the top
            </p>
            <code>
              input = input(' what is your pin') where i =1: kgkjkgkgjhgjkjjgjgk
              klfkl
            </code>
            <p>
              The stack is also known as last-in , first-out data structure
              (LiFo)
            </p>
            <p>
              Stacks are commonly used for parsing and evaluating mathematical
              expressions and to implement function calls in recursion
              programming
            </p>
            <h2>Queues</h2>
            <p>
              Queue is a type of list where data are inserted at the end and are
              removed from the front.
            </p>
            <p>
              A queue functions similary to a <strong>stack</strong> but instead
              of being a LiFo structure it is a FiFo
              structure(Fist-in,First-out)
            </p>
            <p>
              The easiest way to think about a queue is to think of a line of
              people waiting to enter a building. The person at the begining of
              the line will enter the building first while the last person at
              end will enter last
            </p>
            <h2>Harsh Tables</h2>
            <p>
              Hash table associates each value with a key and then stores them.
              Harsh tables are excellent for quick storage and easy retrieval of
              data using key-value pairs
            </p>
            <p>
              Harsh tables are designed around an <strong>array</strong> data
              structure it is an efficient way of inserting and searching for
              data regardless of its size as it makes easy to identify a
              specific object from a group of similar objects
            </p>
            <p>
              For example if you go to college you be assigned a unique student
              id number. This id number is a way that can be used to retrieve
              information about you and your student records
            </p>
            <p>
              Harsh tables use a function to map a data set of any size to one
              of a fixed size. Value returned by harsh table are known as harsh
              values
            </p>
            <p>
              Hash tables are commonly used to create database indexes, create
              associative arrays and to create a set
            </p>
            <h2>Trees</h2>
            <p>
              Trees are the most common used data structure in computer science.
              A tree is non-linear data structure that is used to store data in
              a hierachial mannaer
            </p>

            <p>
              Tree data structure are used to store hierachial data such as the
              files in file system and storing sorted list of data.
            </p>
            <p>
              They various types of trees each suited to different application
            </p>
            <p>
              For example a binary search tree (BST) stores data in a sorted
              order with every node in the binary comprised of the following.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Key(the value saved in the node)</li>
              <li>Left(pointer to the left child node)</li>
              <li>Right(pointer to the right child node)</li>
              <li>P(parent node)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Binary search trees are used in many application. Other types of
              trees are used in wireless networking and to create expression
              solvers
            </p>
            <h2>Heaps</h2>
            <p>
              A heap is a type of binary tree in which the parent node are
              compared to their children. This allows the values within the node
              to be arranged accordingly.
            </p>

            <p>There are two types of heaps</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Min heap</li>
              <li>Max heap</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Heaps are often algorithms to create priority queues and to find
              the smallest and largest in an array.
            </p>
            <h2>Graphs</h2>
            <p>Graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges.</p>
            <p>
              Think of a map of any country. Each town is connected with other
              towns via some type of road. A map is type of graph where each
              town is vertex and a road that connects two towns is an edge.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Here are 8 of the most used data structures in computer science. I
              hope you enjoyed please keep on learning
